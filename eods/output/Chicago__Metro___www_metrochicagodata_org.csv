Service Requests,"The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  
If a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of ""Duplicate (Open)"".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of ""Duplicate (Open)"".
Once the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and ""Duplicate (Closed)"" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a “cave-in” or “failed utility cut”, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor.

Service Requests,"All open reports of ""Street Lights - All Out"" (an outage of 3 or more lights) made to 311 and all requests completed since January 1, 2011.The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees approximately 250,000 street lights that illuminate arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents’ reports of street light outages. 

Whenever CDOT receives a report of an “All Out” the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure that they are all working properly. If a second request of lights out in the same circuit is made within four calendar days of the original request, the newest request is automatically given the status of “Duplicate (Open).” Since CDOT's electrician will be looking at all the lights in a circuit to verify that they are all working, any “Duplicate (Open)” address will automatically be observed and repaired. 

Once the street lights are repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported lights are inspected but found to be in good repair and functioning; when the service request is for a non-existent address; or when the lights are maintained by a contractor.
