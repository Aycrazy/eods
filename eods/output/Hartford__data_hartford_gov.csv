Health and Human Services,"A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2015. A ""Y"" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.
Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.
The “Morphine (Not Heroin)” values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as “Morphine (not heroin).”  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.

The Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) introduced the four-year cohort graduation rate with the graduating class of 2009. This approach was created when Connecticut and 49 other states signed an agreement with the National Governors’ Association to develop a uniform system for tracking students.  The four-year cohort graduation rate is calculated by tracking an individual cohort, or group of students, from their initial entrance into Grade 9 through to graduation. The four-year cohort graduation rate represents the percentage of students who earn a standard high school diploma within four years. The calculation uses individual student-level data from the state's Public School Information System (PSIS) that school districts submitted and superintendents certified.

Asterisk symbol (*) denotes fewer than six in a cohort is suppressed;
