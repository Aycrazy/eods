b'Housing & Development',"b'In April 2013, the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors approved an allocation, through a ""Notice of Funding Availability"" (NOFA) process, of approximately $13.4 million of unrestricted General Funds for affordable housing purposes. These funds were derived from a one-time distribution of Housing Trust Funds held by former redevelopment agencies in San Mateo County. These unrestricted general funds - which initiated the County\'s Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) - were set aside to provide financial assistance for the development of multifamily affordable rental housing and provision of emergency and transitional shelter in the County. The Board directed the County\'s Department of Housing to develop allocation guidelines and recommend projects for funding.  As of May 2014, approximately $13.2 million of AHF funds have been allocated, collectively, to six multifamily affordable rental housing developments and four emergency and transitional housing projects (""AHF 1.0"").\nOn August 5, 2014, the County Board of Supervisors authorized the Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo to publish another NOFA, using funds from the Housing Authority\'s Housing Assistance Program (HAP) Reserves to create affordable housing options for low-, very low-, and extremely low-income households. A total of $5 million was awarded to five projects, including three multifamily affordable housing rental developments, a homeownership project, and a farmworker housing program. This became the second funding round of the AHF (""AHF 2.0"").'",b'Affordable Housing Map (embed)',Housing-Development/Affordable-Housing-Map-embed-/6cby-7es6,b'Map'

b'Transportation',"b'The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other government entities have issued regulations for flying Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or, more commonly, drones. Areas of exclusion include National Parks, Military Bases, and with notification restrictions within a 5 mile area of airports. This map shows areas where drones cannot be flown (over the Golden Gate National Recreation Area) as well as areas where UAS operators must notify an airport or control tower when flying within 5 nautical miles of an airport. The following are the most important regulations related to UAS operations: 1. Fly no higher than 400 feet and remain below any surrounding obstacles when possible. 2. Do not intentionally fly over unprotected persons or moving vehicles, and remain at least 25 feet away from individuals and vulnerable property. 3. Check and follow all local laws and ordinances before flying over private property. 4. Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations, and you must see and avoid other aircraft and obstacles at all times. 5. Contact the airport or control tower before flying within five miles of an airport. The full set of regulations can be found on the Know Before You Fly Site: http://knowbeforeyoufly.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KBYF_Brochure.pdfThis data comes from a Mapbox project: https://www.mapbox.com/blog/dont-fly-here/'",b'Drone No Fly Zones',Transportation/Drone-No-Fly-Zones/avpy-7s48,b'Map'
